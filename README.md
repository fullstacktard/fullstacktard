solo dev building crypto/web3 products, shipping fast, ignoring VC narratives

currently building at **[Duel](https://duel.casino)** (online casino) | previously co-founded **Pr3sence** (web3 ad server) & **Nomen Market** (NEAR Protocol wallet/marketplace) | did time at **PWC** doing data & analytics before escaping to build shit that matters

## what i'm working on

**[claude-workflow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/claude-workflow)** - templating system for Claude Code that actually works. got tired of context management hell and built the config I wish existed from day one. opinionated, structured, gets out of your way so you can ship.

also building random fullstack projects for clients and myself, mostly crypto/web3 stuff

## recent thoughts

**[5 VC Dogmas in AI That Don't Matter When You're Bootstrapped](https://fst.wtf/ai-vc-dogmas)**
why everything VCs say about AI wrappers, data moats, and first-mover advantage is completely irrelevant when you're a solo dev just trying to hit $5k MRR

**[Claude Kept Forgetting My Workflow, So I Made It Impossible to Forget](https://fst.wtf/why-i-built-claude-workflow)**
how I went from context management chaos to shipping fast with a simple templating system

why Meta keeps shipping hollow products while Sora blows up overnight, and what it means for where tech is headed
